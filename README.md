## Dependencies on Linux

Audio should work out-of-the-box on macOS, Windows, and iOS. For Linux, the downstream package for actually playing
sound requires the Alsa development libraries to be installed.

### CentOS

```shell
sudo yum install -y alsa-lib-devel
```

### Debian/Ubuntu

```shell
sudo apt install libasound2-dev pkg-config
```
